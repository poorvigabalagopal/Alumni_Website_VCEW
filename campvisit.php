<h3><b> Campusvisit:</b> </h3>
<p>   A college tour, also called a campus tour, is a tour of a college or university's campus. Prospective students, their family members and other visitors take campus tours to learn about the college or university's facilities, as well as student life, 
culture on campus, academics, and programs offered by the institution.
   During these tours, prospective students are able to learn about the built environment and the overall look and feel of the institution.
   College tours may be taken individually or by school groups and educational programs as a way for many people to visit several schools over a short period of time. In addition, many colleges now offer virtual tours on the Internet.<br><b>College timing:9.00AM-4.00PM</b></p>
